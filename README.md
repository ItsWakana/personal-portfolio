# Personal Portfolio

## What I learned

- I considered a mobile first approach from the get go with this portfolio project. The spec wanted a dynamic website which could work on mobile and desktop so that was the main goal. Heavy use of flexbox and min and max sizing to achieve this was used. I tried to limit myself from using fixed sizes.

- Implmenting the majority of my CSS with tailwind: I wrote most of my css inline with tailwind, this included using tailwinds in built media query options.

## How I could improve moving forward

- Continue working on my tailwind CSS and improve effeciency using it. 

- Work more with flexbox as well as grid. I feel that grid is very good when used in combination with flex.
